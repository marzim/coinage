You will often hear phrases like, “the forex arena”, “bulls battling the bears”, “you compete with the best and brightest minds in the world”. This is convenient and filled to the brim with conflict (we love drama just watch the news). What the general perception of market speculation tends to ignore is the passive and perhaps less entertaining side of the trading equation: the waiting game.\r\n\r\nAs newer traders enter the market and begin to “inform” themselves as to the inner workings of their particular instrument, be it equities, options, futures or forex, they begin to learn about things like trends, and fundamental forces. Somehow they start out with the mentality that they have to “catch” the big move to be successful at this. I believe it is this reactionary conditioning that leads to the impulsive behavior of the new and misinformed trader population.\r\n\r\nAs newer traders, we have all experienced the feelings of frustration after missing an extensive market move in one direction. These frustrations mount and lead to reactions like jumping into the first uptick that shows up after a bearish correction with little or no information to suggest the correction is complete. These frustrations also lead to fixating on the previous “trend” or what has happened in the most recent price history, leading you to continue to project this trend forward because human nature insists on making sense of chaos.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the line, the concept of “they” emerges. You begin saying things like, “They took the market 100 pips after I shorted it”, or “they stopped me out exactly at the bottom”. It seems as though this “they” controls the market, and it is you against “them”. The force that moves prices is the aggregate decision of the majority of participants. If there are a great deal more buyers than sellers, price goes up, and vice versa. If there is no majority, guess where price goes? Nowhere.\r\n\r\nI like to think of the speculative process of trading to be more like the patient act of fishing. I don’t fish, but here is what I understand about it: You wake up very early and go to a spot on a lake where there tends to be a high frequency of fish. You put your line in the water and you WAIT. A fish may come along and grab your bait without getting caught by your hook. Ok no problem, it’s a small loss. You can afford to give bait away all day long. Eventually what happens though? You catch a nice big fish.\r\n\r\nTrading is less about fighting someone and more about recognizing a condition that offers the most potential for the least amount of risk. Once recognized, you then have to have the patience to wait for it to appear. This doesn’t mean you will always win, but it means you found a way to improve your chances of winning compared to a random outcome.\r\n\r\nTrading is more about having good “visual” listening skills than it is about imposing your own ideas and opinions. From a discretionary standpoint, it is more about understanding the market’s organics imperfections than it is about being an exact science. It’s about employing a passive approach that emphasizes waiting to act on unique conditions (fishing in the right spot) than about reacting to obvious and most likely obsolete information (fighting the forex battle against the “them”.) The market speaks it’s own language. Learn it and don’t speak, just listen and it’s intentions become much clearer.\r\n</br>\r\nsource: http://www.smbtraining.com/blog/trading-less-fighting-more-fishing','2014-01-30 07:09:16',1),(9,'Stopping the Marcoses from erasing their crimes from history','By Raïssa Robles</br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zv16YKTSASI/UvYaWVlWXDI/AAAAAAAAAG4/BC2JCLAgisg/s800/Marcoses---Marahas-at-Mapur.jpg\" /> </br>\r\nI would like to thank the Third World Studies Center, its director Dr. Ricardo Jose, the forum moderator Dr. Luisa Camagay, and Dr. Teresita Maceda for inviting me to speak at the forum.\r\nMy speech was based on documents and my personal experiences during and after Martial Law.\r\nThere are, however, some variations between the text and my actual speech since I inserted some additional explanations and anecdotes during the speech.\r\nI also added a third reason to explain why the Marcoses are back in power.\r\n</br>\r\nGood morning. Before I begin, let me tell you a personal story.\r\nThis building, once upon a time, was where I first met Imee Marcos. She was the main actor in a Tagalog version of Animal Farm directed by Prof. Jonas Sebastian. And I was the play’s stage manager.</br>\r\nI recall that Jonas had to change some of her lines because these would hit too close to home. Because Animal Farm was about a revolution that went bad. Just like what was then happening with Marcos’ “Revolution from the Center.”\r\nWell, Marcos was overthrown. And slowly, succeeding governments turned into versions of Animal Farm.</br>\r\nToday, the Marcoses are back, and behaving as if the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution never happened.</br>\r\nA growing number of Filipinos – many of them born after EDSA – are even hoping to put Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos in Malacañang Palace two years from now.</br>\r\nLet me try to deconstruct how Ferdinand Marcos, a brutal, murderous and greedy dictator, could even be considered a hero by a number of Filipinos 25 years after his death and 28 years after his tyrannical rule.\r\nLet me try to deconstruct how his widow Imelda and their three children are now back in the highest rungs of society. And much admired.\r\nIt’s a key lesson to all grafters: Steal small, you end up in jail. You’ve got to steal big like the Marcoses.\r\nI use the word “steal” without equivocation because the Swiss Federal Court itself described in its 2003 landmark ruling that returned close to US$1 billion dollars of what the Marcos loot had become – that all that money was – and I quote – “of criminal origin.”</br>\r\nIf that is the case, why is no Marcos in jail? In fact, why are three of them in positions of power?</br>\r\nLet me offer two three reasons.</br>\r\nONE – The foremost reason is that the generation that overthrew the Marcos conjugal dictatorship thought that the regime was so brutal and so greedy in its accumulation of wealth and power, that people did not need further reminding of it.</br>\r\nThe People Power generation forgot to document all these for future generations.\r\nSure, Nick Joaquin came out with the book Quarter of the Tiger Moon. And there was that coffee table book on People Power.</br>\r\nBut to this day, the History of the Filipino People written by UP historians Teodoro Agoncillo and Milagros Guerrero – which a lot of schools continue to use as their history textbooks – has not been updated to include the Marcos years and the years afterward.</br>\r\nConsequently, the succeeding generations really have no idea why si Malakas at si Maganda – the Powerful and the Beautiful – that was the myth propagated by the Marcos couple about themselves – are really si Marahas at si Mapurot.\r\nIn Waray, “mapurot” means ugly and undesirable.</br>\r\nPart of the reason is that many intellectuals who could have written about that era were co-opted by the dictatorship to become propagandists or to turn out think tank reports. They are therefore ashamed to reveal what they did during Martial Law.</br>\r\nThe building where the UP Asian Center used to be was the seat of Marcos’ think tank. It was called the Philippine Center for Advanced Studies or PCAS. Its head was Col. Joe Almonte. Whatever study Marcos wanted, it churned out.\r\nI know because as a young graduate, I was hired to do radio scripts for its Kasaysayan ng Lahing Pilipino series. I quit before the series touched on Marcos.</br>\r\nIn the absence of an extensive history covering the Marcos regime, the Marcos family was able to hawk the following myths to new voters:</br>\r\n1.That Martial law was a “benevolent dictatorship”</br>\r\n2.That there were no human rights abuses during the period. As Senator Bongbong Marcos said, the alleged victims are only after money.</br>\r\n3.That the economy boomed under Marcos</br>\r\n4.That Marcos was the greatest president since he built the most number of infrastructure, notably the Cultural Center, Folk Arts Theater, Film Center, Heart Center, Kidney Center, Lung Center and San Juanico Bridge. You can see this particular claim all over the social networking sites Facebook and Youtube.\r\nI’ll take these up now one by one.</br>\r\nMarcos called his regime a “benevolent dictatorship”, a “smiling Martial Law”. The reality was that fear prevailed throughout the country and the smile was grotesque.</br>\r\nIn the Catholic school which I attended, a directive came down from the nuns after Martial Law was declared. Henceforth, during lunchtime, we were banned from eating three or more to a table. Because that would be a form of “illegal assembly.”</br>\r\nWhat do girls not even in their teens know about subversion? I had no idea what it meant at that time.</br>\r\nBut that was how much Marcos controlled the population.</br>\r\nThe military and the police could also pick up anybody at will on the street or right in their homes.</br>\r\nAnd one had to be very careful about making jokes about the Marcoses and the “New Society” in public.</br>\r\nIt was really only after the Marcoses fell that Filipinos got to know the full horror of his New Society. There were at least 10,000 human rights victims who were killed, or were tortured and survived.</br>\r\nJust to give a rough calculation of how bad the human rights situation was and the extent of dissent against his New Society – for every month that Marcos held on as a dictator while his wife, Human Settlements Minister Imelda Marcos, indulged in shopping sprees abroad, 700 human rights victims would be added to the roster.</br>\r\nOr for each day he was in power as dictator, there were 23 new victims. Or almost every hour of the 14 years he remained a dictator, nearly one citizen was killed or tortured.</br>\r\nEven the beautiful Governor of Ilocos Norte, Imee Marcos, has blood on her hands. A student from Mapua named Archimedes Trajano once questioned her – whether the daughter of the President had to head the Kabataang Barangay.\r\nTrajano was later found dead. Investigators claimed he died in a frat rumble.\r\nTrajano’s mother filed a lawsuit in the US against Imee Marcos. The mother won the lawsuit.</br>\r\nAlthough I was never an activist I knew arrests were going on, because my father, who was a UP Law Professor, played a role in getting some of them out of jail. One was Gerry Barican. I’m not sure if another was Herminio Sonny Coloma. Another was someone who I believe would have made my father turn in his grave today. His name was Gary Olivar – President Gloria Arroyo’s propagandist.\r\nThis is interesting. All three became presidential spokesmen.</br>\r\nI can laugh about this now. But at that time, my father’s actions had serious consequences for my family. The Bureau of Internal Revenue suddenly told my father they could not believe he was that poor. If only the BIR had conducted a home visit, it would clarify what they thought was his unexplained poverty.\r\nThe BIR kept hounding him for high tax payments. In desperation, my mother turned to a neighbor employed at the BIR. He told her that the assessment for that year would be settled provided she paid something “for the boys”.\r\nEvery time that happened, my mother had to take it out of our food budget. I remember there were times that we were able to eat only because a customer of my mom, who sewed dresses, would suddenly pay her.</br>\r\nAnd so, even though I wasn’t an activist, I knew first-hand the consequences of dissent against Marcos.</br>\r\nAnd that’s not all. Marcos and his in-laws, the Romualdezes, had nearly total control of Philippine media – the TV, Radio and newspapers.</br>\r\nThe Marcos-Romualdez-controlled media did not show the true extent of the Mindanao wars – the wars when Nur Misuari, Hashim Salamat and Murad Ebrahim fought as one under the banner of the Moro National Liberation Front.\r\nAn estimated 60,000 to 80,000 civilians and rebels died in Mindanao between 1972 and 1976. Over one million residents fled.</br>\r\nMarcos redrew the southern Philippine map, wrenched Palawan away from Mindanao, partitioned the south, and gave these to his various military commanders to govern.</br>\r\nMarcos’ actions in Mindanao and the ignorance of the people of Luzon about these, would fuel mistrust between the two populations and add to the misunderstanding of why the Muslim south wants autonomy.</br>\r\nLet me go now to Marcos’ “achievements” during Martial Law. It is true that he built those buildings and that bridge in the 20 years he was in power – from December 30, 1965 to February 25, 1986.</br>\r\nBut at what cost? And how much was his commission? His tongpats?</br>\r\nWhen he became president in 1965, the Philippine foreign debt was less than US$1 billion. By the time he and his family fled, this had ballooned to US$27 billion – a nearly US$26 billion increase. That’s over US$1 billion per year.</br>\r\nThe Presidential Commission on Good Government that was formed in 1986 estimated that the Marcoses had managed to loot up to US$10 billion. That’s 40% of what his regime borrowed.</br>\r\nBut those who love him never talk about the foreign debt his government left behind. Nor do they talk about one other key achievement of his governance – the substantial devaluation of the Philippine peso.</br>\r\nWhen Marcos was elected in 1965 on the promise that “This nation will be great again”, the value of the peso was P3.90 to the dollar.</br>\r\nWhen he proclaimed Martial Law in order to build a New Society in 1972, the peso had sunk to P6.77 per dollar. When Senator Benigno Ninoy Aquino was assassinated in 1983, the peso plummeted to P11 per dollar. And when the Marcoses fled in 1986, it was P20 per dollar.</br>\r\nThose are the real achievements of Marcos – a US$25 billion increase in foreign debt; a nosediving peso from P3.90 to P20; and possibly US$20 billion in payoffs.</br>\r\nOn top of that, there is the grinding poverty symbolized by Manila’s Smokey Mountain and the export of Filipinos as slave labor to the Middle East.</br>\r\nPlease consider this: According to the 2003 judgment issued by former Supreme Court chief Justice Renato Corona on Civil Case 0141 or the civil forfeiture case against the Marcoses’ Net Worth was US$957,487.75 or under ONE MILLION DOLLARS when they fled in 1986.</br>\r\nSo how do the Marcoses even account for the US$356 million which the Swiss government unilaterally froze in 1986 and later gave back to the Philippine government with interest?</br>\r\nIn addition, how does Imelda Marcos account for her three jewelry collections worth a combined US$4 million? Last month, one collection was awarded to the Philippine government. But last week, Senator Bongbong Marcos submitted an appeal to have the decision reversed, saying the government never specified this particular collection in its forfeiture suit.</br>\r\nHe also said a curious thing last week – he said Pres. Benigno Aquino should apologize for the botched rescue of Hongkongers who were taken hostage in a tourist bus in 2010. He said, “the refusal to apologize I find hard to understand.”</br>\r\nBongbong Marcos and his family have never apologized to the human rights victims. They don’t exist as far as they’re concerned.</br>\r\nThis raises serious questions why Bongbong Marcos wants to be president in the first place. Is it to quash all pending cases against the Marcos family and to retrieve the assets?</br>\r\nThe government has hinted it will auction off the jewelry.</br>\r\nThat would be a gross mistake. The jewelry belongs to the Filipino people. It was acquired with the blood of human rights victims, and the shattered promise of a better future. It is part of our process of remembering as a people the grand-scale plunder and corruption that took place during the dictatorship, and that should never ever happen again.</br>\r\nDo you know that I tried to obtain photos of the jewelry from PCGG and I was told not yet because this is under litigation? But do you know that the same pieces of contested jewelry have been published in a coffee-table book called “Thoroughly Imeldific”?</br>\r\nThe public does remember Imelda Marcos’ jewelry but in the wrong context. The jewelry projects her as a patroness of the arts and a lover of “the true, the good, and the beautiful.” It does not remember her as the shopaholic who diverted for her own pleasure the tax money that should have helped the poor.</br>\r\nFor Marcos lovers like Irene Vinluan, such displays of corrupt practices apparently does not matter. She wrote on the Facebook page of Marcos’ daughter, Imee:</br>\r\n“I love the Marcoses! During the time of his Presidency, despite of his corruption, at the same time, he also did good for the country, the streets was cleaner, not much street crimes, the Philippines was one of the richest in Asia.”</br>\r\nLet’s replace the word “Marcos” with Hitler; and use Germany instead of the Philippines, and see how that reads:</br>\r\n“I love Hitler! During the time of his Chancellorship, despite of his corruption, at the same time, he also did good for the country, the streets was cleaner, not much street crimes, Germany was one of the richest in Europe.”</br>\r\nUnfair?</br>\r\nNot at all. Marcos himself disclosed that one of the things he studied in preparation for declaring Martial Law was how Hitler took control of Germany.</br>\r\nBy the way, it is not true that no Marcos was ever criminally convicted. Imelda Marcos was convicted of corruption on September 24, 1993 and sentenced up to 24 years in jail. But President Fidel Ramos’ solicitor general inexplicably – some would say explicably – threw the case away by telling the Supreme Court ti was wrong to accuse her.</br>\r\nTWO – Another reason why we have this serious memory gap about the Marcoses’ evil deeds is that they and their supporters are exploiting certain cultural norms and Filipino values to help them propagate their own version of reality.</br>\r\nHere are four such norms:</br>\r\nThe first norm is – Respect your elder.</br>\r\nFerdinand Marcos exploited this by calling himself “Apo” , which in Ilocano means “elder person in authority.”</br>\r\nAnd Imelda Marcos, no matter how foolish she sounds and how much in debt she sunk the Philippine treasury because of her wanton shopping sprees, is still accorded similar respect because she’s old.</br>\r\nOne of the things I vividly remember the day after the Marcoses fled was my visit inside Malacanang Palace. As a political reporter for Business Day newspaper, I was able to get inside the palace and I could go anywhere.</br>\r\nBea Zobel, wife of Jaime Zobel and and her friend Mercy Tuazon were both inside helping to tally up the goods that had been left behind.</br>\r\n“Have you seen Rustan’s”, I remember one of them telling me. “No,” I said.</br>\r\nThey led me to a room beneath Imelda’s room. All her shoes were there. Plus stacks and stacks of underwear and brassieres. But one thing that struck me was inside her bathroom. It was a HUGE bottle of branded perfume which was nearly as tall as I am and which was nearly full. I don’t think you could have finished it by spraying it in one lifetime unless you bathed in it.</br>\r\nI also remember that every room had bunches of wilting flowers. Imelda Marcos spent a princely sum on imported flowers, according to PCGG findings.</br>\r\nWhen Ferdinand Marcos died in 1989, his family and supporters exploited a second cultural norm: Do not speak ill of the dead.</br>\r\nThis one goes against the very writing of history. I understand that the history major in UP is now an endangered specie. This is crazy. This is sad. This is pathetic. A nation cannot move forward without drawing lessons from its past.\r\nI salute those who continue writing history despite financial challenges.</br>\r\nThe third cultural norm that Marcos lovers throw at critics is – Forgive your enemies.</br>\r\nA person who does not forgive his enemies is often labeled vindictive. And if he’s a politician, he’s called politically vindictive.</br>\r\nI remember that during the presidency of Corazon Aquino, the board of censors chief Manoling Morato said the public should stop demonizing Marcos in the spirit of reconciliation.</br>\r\nWe are now reaping the consequences of that advice. Marcos’ children and his wife to this day insist their father did no wrong; there were no human rights abuses; and he is the country’s greatest president.</br>\r\nThe fourth cultural norm has very serious implications for the country’s future. And this is – Do not bring the sins of the father on his children.</br>\r\nEven the left-wing activist, former Congressman Satur Ocampo, justified Bayan Muna’s strange political alliance with Bongbong Marcos in 2010 using this very argument. Ocampo said, “We are not collecting from the son.”</br>\r\nBut the son has long been in cahoots with his father and mother. He early on tried to get someone to withdraw the stash from Switzerland. In fact the son is now the legal executor of his father’s estate. And long before that, the son was one of the named beneficiaries of the US$356 million Swiss bank accounts.</br>\r\nYou see, the Marcoses’ secret Swiss accounts were all under pseudonyms. But the Marcos couple had to sign separate documents saying they owned these accounts. They also had to sign another set of papers naming their beneficiaries in case they died.</br>\r\nIn February 2011, I was lucky enough to be seated at the same luncheon table as Senator Bongbong Marcos during a press conference of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines. I was also able to ask him questions.</br>\r\nIn answer to my questions, he told me he would continue to pursue a compromise settlement with the government on the Marcos cases and frozen assets. But he refused to confirm that he was named a beneficiary in the Swiss accounts.</br>\r\nHere is a direct quote of what he said when I asked him to confirm that he was a named beneficiary of multi-million dollar accounts in Switzerland:</br>\r\n“I cannot confirm because I haven’t seen or read them. We – I don’t know. I cannot – I cannot say that I know. Definitely the Swiss money were there. Or are there now. It’s for us – again this constant – that people are saying – more and more participating in that –”</br>\r\nPoor boy, he hasn’t read them. And yet I have read copies of those documents which his father forgot in Malacanang Palace as they left in haste in February 1986.</br>\r\nUnderstandably, the dictator’s children are trying to reinstate their father politically.\r\nBut they are doing it with our tax money.</br>\r\nFor instance, many key activities of Governor Imee Marcos for Ilocos Norte is intended to praise her father Ferdinand Marcos. Last year, she held the:\r\n“President Marcos cup” for practical shooting;</br>\r\nA rock concert called “DaReal Makoy Concert 2”;</br>\r\nA “Marcos fiesta 2013 Flash Mob Full” which details the life of Marcos in dance; </br>and\r\n“The First Ferdinand Marcos Sirib Intercollegiate debates 2013.”</br>\r\nSeptember 11, Marcos’ birthday, was dubbed “Marcos Day”.</br>\r\nImee Marcos held a “Little Macoy and Imelda sing-alike”, a “Marcos quiz”, a “Marcos heritage trail free tour.”</br>\r\nIn 2012, the family published a book on the arts and culture of the Marcos era.\r\nAnd of course there is the year-round exhibit of Marcos’ waxed figure as well as a museum of remembrance.</br>\r\nAll these are intended to project the Marcos version of history. Before Facebook and Twitter came about, such goings-on would have been confined in Ilocos. But not anymore.</br>\r\nThe Marcoses are now using Facebook and YouTube to project their father as the greatest president this country ever had.</br>\r\nHow attitude to the Marcoses have changed\r\nThe Social Weather Stations has tried tracking public sentiment regarding Ferdinand Marcos. By 1998, 12 years after he was booted out, SWS took a poll and compared it with previous similar polls it had taken.</br>\r\nSWS said it found the following:</br>\r\nOn the statement that Marcos was a “thief of the nation’s wealth”, public opinion “shifted from unfavorable in 1986 to neutral in 1995 and 1998.”</br>\r\nOn the statement that he was a “brutal and oppressive president”, public sentiment shifted “from a split opinion in 1986 to a favorable opinion in 1995 and 1998.”</br>\r\nOn the statement that Imelda Marcos was definitely guilty or not guilty of graft, SWS found that half thought she was “definitely guilty” and only 14% said she wasn’t.</br>\r\nRemember the cultural norm, do not speak ill of the dead?</br>\r\nIn 1998, SWS’ Dr. Mahar Mangahas wrote about “a remarkable softening of public opinion towards Ferdinand Marcos”.</br>\r\nMangahas gave two reasons.</br>\r\nHe said,</br>\r\n“Part of the softening towards Marcos is simply due to demographics. The old pass away, and the youth take their places.”</br>\r\nHe added that:</br>\r\n“Another part, in my view, was due to the fact that in 1986 Marcos was still alive and unrepentant in exile, whereas in 1995 he was already dead.” He added that the survey results were “not about the character of Marcos but about the character of the Filipino people. Not many of us would care to hold a grudge against someone long dead, not even someone like Ferdinand Marcos.”</br>\r\nDr. Mangahas talked about holding a grudge against Marcos.</br>\r\nBut what about keeping a historical truth constant? Making sure the truth survives generations?</br>\r\nBy 2011, Ferdinand Marcos had made a remarkable comeback in public consciousness. When SWS asked respondents to identify their “top three most identified Filipino heroes,” Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio and Ninoy Aquino topped the list in that order.</br>\r\nHowever, Marcos even made the list – cited by 5.1% of respondents. One could say that is the loyal Ilocano vote at work. However, he even bested Ramon Magsaysay and Lapu-Lapu.</br>\r\nA third reason, I believe, why Marcos has been rehabilitated and the Marcoses are back in power is the kind of leadership we have had since 1992 – or six years after the Marcos  fall. As soon as President Fidel Ramos warmed his seat in Malacañang, plans were afoot to forge a compromise settlement with the Marcoses.</br>\r\nBy 1993, one was drawn up and it went something like this: 75% of the Marcos loot would go to the government. But the Marcos family would keep 25%, tax free. All their cases would be dropped. And who’s to say what the total loot really was.\r\nJust think. If the late Atty. Frank Chavez had not petitioned the Supreme Court to stop this deal, the Marcoses would have walked off with billions of pesos, no sweat.</br>\r\nPresident Joseph Estrada, who succeeded Marcos Ramos, tried to push the same deal. Fortunately in December 1998 the Supreme Court threw out the deal and all future talks of compromise.</br>\r\nAssociate Justice Artemio Panganiban who penned the decision wrote then that:\r\n“The waiver of all claims against the Marcoses would be a virtual warrant for all public officials to amass public funds illegally, since there is an option to compromise their liabilities in exchange for only a portion of their ill-gotten wealth.”</br>\r\nThat is the message of Marcos to all politicians, actually. If you must steal, steal big.</br>\r\nWhat we can do as Filipinos</br>\r\nMy husband, who is also a journalist, has repeatedly pointed out to me that Berlin has a documentation center for Nazi crimes. We need to have the same that document what the Marcoses did: especially the actual records of torture, Amnesty International reports of that era and first-person accounts from all sides , including those of the Marcoses.</br>\r\nMy husband has compiled a short list of sources in his satirical website hotmanila.ph. But he has been unable to work on it. Hotmanila is the oldest satirical site, put up 14 years ago. It broke the story on the Love Bug virus.\r\nA Berliner told me last October that school children are told of Hitler’s crimes. The Marcos crimes should be written down as well – in black and white – in our history books.</br>\r\nBesides writing such books, academics can compile – online and offline – a list of credible references about Martial Law. A historiography of Martial law.\r\nAnd we need to engage the Marcos lovers online, by vigorously challenging their delusions and their attempts to erase history.</br>\r\nThe Marcoses destroyed our country and now they are covering up for their crimes.</br>\r\nPlease note that during Martial Law, a seminar like this would have been impossible. All of us would have been arrested within an hour.</br>\r\nThat we are speaking freely now is a testament to how far we have gone in our democracy. That we are still talking about the Marcoses’ probable comeback to center stage shows how dangerously we are regressing and forgetting.</br>\r\nI would now like to show you two souvenirs from that era.</br>\r\nOn the night the Marcoses fled Malacanang Palace, my husband scrambled over the gates of Malacanang. But before that, he took this piece from the barb wire outside Malacanang.</br>\r\nMarcos was afraid of his own people.</br>\r\nThis is what I call my “Macky watch.” It’s a gold watch that was given to guests during his birthday celebration in 1977. It was given to me by a dear friend.</br>\r\nThe barb wire symbolizes the impunity of the Marcos dictatorship. The watch symbolizes the extravagance, especially of Imelda Marcos.</br>\r\nRemember the Marcos myth – si Malakas at Maganda?</br>\r\nThat should be changed to – si Marahas at Mapurot – ugly and undesirable.</br>\r\nsource : www.raissarobles.com/2014/02/09/stopping-the-marcoses-from-erasing-their-crimes-from-history/','2014-02-12 08:53:34',1),(10,'Grandfather paradox','<img src=\"http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/images/mueller_01_07_99.gif\" /></br></br>\r\n\r\nTime travel is impossible as exemplified by the famous grandfather paradox. Imagine you build a time machine. It is possible for you to travel back in time, meet your grandfather before he produces any children (i.e. your father/mother) and kill him. Thus, you would not have been born and the time machine would not have been built, a paradox.</br></br>\r\n\r\nPerhaps the craziest of the time travel paradoxes was cooked up by Robert Heinlein in his classic short story \"All You Zombies.\"</br></br>\r\n\r\nA baby girl is mysteriously dropped off at an orphanage in Cleveland in 1945. \"Jane\" grows up lonely and dejected, not knowing who her parents are, until one day in 1963 she is strangely attracted to a drifter. She falls in love with him. But just when things are finally looking up for Jane, a series of disasters strike. First, she becomes pregnant by the drifter, who then disappears. Second, during the complicated delivery, doctors find that Jane has both sets of sex organs, and to save her life, they are forced to surgically convert \"her\" to a \"him.\" Finally, a mysterious stranger kidnaps her baby from the delivery room.</br></br>\r\n\r\nReeling from these disasters, rejected by society, scorned by fate, \"he\" becomes a drunkard and drifter. Not only has Jane lost her parents and her lover, but he has lost his only child as well. Years later, in 1970, he stumbles into a lonely bar, called Pop\'s Place, and spills out his pathetic story to an elderly bartender. The sympathetic bartender offers the drifter the chance to avenge the stranger who left her pregnant and abandoned, on the condition that he join the \"time travelers corps.\" Both of them enter a time machine, and the bartender drops off the drifter in 1963. The drifter is strangely attracted to a young orphan woman, who subsequently becomes pregnant.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe bartender then goes forward 9 months, kidnaps the baby girl from the hospital, and drops off the baby in an orphanage back in 1945. Then the bartender drops off the thoroughly confused drifter in 1985, to enlist in the time travelers corps. The drifter eventually gets his life together, becomes a respected and elderly member of the time travelers corps, and then disguises himself as a bartender and has his most difficult mission: a date with destiny, meeting a certain drifter at Pop\'s Place in 1970.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe question is: Who is Jane\'s mother, father, grandfather, grand mother, son, daughter, granddaughter, and grandson? The girl, the drifter, and the bartender, of course, are all the same person. These paradoxes can made your head spin, especially if you try to untangle Jane\'s twisted parentage. If we drawJane\'s family tree, we find that all the branches are curled inward back on themselves, as in a circle. We come to the astonishing conclusion that she is her own mother and father! She is an entire family tree unto herself.</br></br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/images/loop.gif\" /></br></br>\r\n\r\nsource: http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/grandfather_paradox.html','2014-02-12 09:03:14',1),(11,'Movies -Updated-','Here\'s the movies that need to watch:\r<br />\nhttp://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\n[NEW]\r<br />\n\r<br />\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086973/\r<br />\n\r<br />\n[True Romance]\r<br />\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108399/?ref_=sr_1\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new\r<br />\nhttp://www.imdb.com/list/ls001895265?ref_=tt_rls_2\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNEW\r<br />\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/duQJM\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew series\r<br />\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4192998/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\r<br />\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4445154/?ref_=nv_sr_1\r<br />\n\r<br />\n[New]\r<br />\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581932/\r<br />\n\r<br />\n[New]\r<br />\nThe wailing\r<br />\nTunnels\r<br />\nThe age of shadows\r<br />\nViolent prosecutors\r<br />\n','2017-03-31 10:00:13',2),(12,'Stock Investing','Here\'s a nice article about stock investing. http://fqmom.com/like-stocks-investing-everyone/','2014-11-03 12:57:26',2),(13,'2014 is almost over','It\'s November and 1 more month to go and we\'re saying goodbye to 2014.

It’s the one that I will wear on my funeral a few months from now. It may not match my suit, but I think it’s perfect for the occasion.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe cancer diagnosis came too late to give me at least a tenuous hope for a long life, but I realized that the most important thing about death is to ensure that you leave this world a little better than it was before you existed with your contributions . The way I’ve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBefore, there were so many things that occupied my mind. When I learned how much time I had left, however, it became clear which things are really important. So, I am writing to you for a selfish reason. I want to give meaning to my life by sharing with you what I have realized:\r\n</p><p>\r\nDon’t waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy. It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like. Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt’s stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you‘re a legend.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTake control of your life Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAppreciate the people around you Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI\'m not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful. I only regret that I will not be able to see a lot of cool stuff that should happen soon like the creation of AI, or Elon Musk’s next awesome project. I also hope that the war in Syria and Ukraine will end soon.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWe care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nYou can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. I hope you will make the right choice.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLeave a mark in this world. Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it. The place we are leaving is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that flies with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting.
